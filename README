krakrat
mperron (2014)

A system for storing links you want to read later. Build a stack of
links and pop them off as soon as you're done with them...or don't, and
become a krakrat!

This module requires MySQL. As a super user (e.g. root) in MySQL, create
the database and grant kraknet@localhost full permissions to that
database.

	create database rat;
	grant all on rat.* to 'kraknet'@'localhost';
