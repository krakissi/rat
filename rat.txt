So basically, there's a table of users that map to rat-specific ID ints.
Another table holds stack objects, with a weak entity tying the users to
stacks with a permission level.
	0 - owner
	1 - contributor
	2 - subscriber

Stacks are comprised of Link objects, so a weak entity connects Links to
Stacks.
