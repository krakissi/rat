There's a table of users that map to rat-specific ID ints. Another table
holds stack objects, with a weak entity tying the users to stacks with a
permission level.
	0 - owner
	1 - contributor
	2 - subscriber

Stacks are comprised of Link objects, so a weak entity connects Links to
Stacks.

Link
	id_link - integer
	uri - the full link to the original document
	short - a shortened version of the link, if available, as from a URL
		shortening service. (derpy.me, etc.)
	date - datetime when the link was added.

stacklink
	id_stack
	id_link
	addedby - integer, user id who added this element to the list

Stack
	id_stack - integer
	creator - integer, rat ID int of the original creator. May no longer
		be the owner of this stack.
	name - pretty, user defined named. Only used for presentation.
	date - datetime when the stack was created.

userstack
	id_user
	id_stack
	permission - 0, 1, or 2; defines access level.
		0 - owner
		1 - contributor
		2 - subscriber

User
	id_user - integer, unique to rat module, not tied to kws accounts IDs
	name - user's name
	date - datetime user first started using rat.

Query Examples
--------------

Select all of the links for a particular username:
	SELECT sl.id_stack, l.id_link, l.uri
	FROM link AS l
	LEFT JOIN stacklink AS sl ON l.id_link = sl.id_link
	LEFT JOIN stack AS s ON sl.id_stack = s.id_stack
	LEFT JOIN userstack AS us ON s.id_stack = us.id_stack
	LEFT JOIN user AS u ON u.id_user = us.id_user
	WHERE u.name='krakissi';


User Experience
---------------

	On the homepage, the user should see a list of all their stacks
(perm levels 0, 1, and 2) with a short sampling (maybe 3) of the newest
links pushed onto that stack. Another list should show the newest links
from all stacks (top 10 or so).
